      "a holistic approach to treating acute pain\n",
      "\n",
      " boston--(business wire)--more than 63,000 people in the us died of drug overdoses in 2016, and two-thirds of those overdoses involved prescription or illicit opioids. even as health care providers have in many instances reversed once liberal prescribing of opioids — a significant factor driving the spike in addiction and deaths — open questions remain about how to safely and effectively treat acute pain without over-reliance on these drugs. pain management is a #patientsafety issue, #opioids are only one option for safe, effective care, says new resource from @theihitweet this now, the institute for healthcare improvement (ihi), a leader in health and health care worldwide, has developed a resource to help health professionals working on this issue. advancing the safety of acute pain management calls for shifting the paradigm from an expectation that pain can be eliminated to one in which clinicians work with patients and families to manage pain in the context of functional and quality of life goals — and where opioids are only one option for pain control. “providing comprehensive, holistic, safe care for patients with acute pain while minimizing the use of opioids is a very challenging goal for health care organizations and clinicians,” said patricia mcgaffigan, rn, ms, cpps, vice president, safety programs, ihi. “our aim with this new resource is to illuminate acute pain management as a patient safety priority and to assist the field in developing an effective pain management strategy.” while there are existing clinical guidelines for treating pain, often organized by medical specialty such as cardiology or oncology, the new resource recommends that every health care organization develop an overarching strategy for treating acute pain. in practice, such a strategy requires assessing organizational strengths and weaknesses around opioid prescribing; determining what metrics to use to measure improvements; and developing and implementing plans that include comprehensive staff education and training and a patient-centered approach to pain assessment and treatment. advancing the safety of acute pain management was made possible by financial support from pacira pharmaceuticals to further the patient safety mission and the delivery of safe care. ihi exercised sole and independent control of all content and editorial decisions related to the project. “we believe breaking down departmental silos will allow organizations to comprehensively tackle the complex issues associated with acute pain management through the development of centralized goals and plans,” said richard scranton, chief medical officer at pacira pharmaceuticals. “inadequate management of acute pain is a patient safety issue, and we hope the tools included in this resource will help organizations develop robust pain management strategies focused on improving the overall patient recovery process.” specifically aimed at hospitals, emergency departments, ambulatory surgical centers, and other settings where patients are most likely to be dealing with acute pain, the new resource includes templates for conducting organizational assessments and a case example of how to build an effective, safe, pain management strategy. ihi is offering health professionals a related virtual training session. pain management: moving beyond opioids begins march 6 and continues in weekly sessions over five weeks. this resource will also be featured at an all-day workshop at the ihi patient safety congress, may 15–17, in houston. about the institute for healthcare improvement (ihi)the institute for healthcare improvement (ihi) is an independent not-for-profit organization based in boston, massachusetts, usa. for more than 25 years, ihi has used improvement science to advance and sustain better outcomes in health and health systems across the world. ihi brings awareness of safety and quality to millions, catalyzes learning and the systematic improvement of care, develops solutions to previously intractable challenges, and mobilizes health systems, communities, regions, and nations to reduce harm and deaths. ihi collaborates with a growing community to spark bold, inventive ways to improve the health of individuals and populations. ihi generates optimism, harvests fresh ideas, and supports anyone, anywhere who wants to profoundly change health and health care for the better. learn more at ihi.org. ihi does not in any way endorse or recommend any products or services provided by pacira or any other commercial entity, nor is any commercial influence or bias allowed or reflected in the content of this resource. \n",

      "\n",
      " south san francisco, calif.--(business wire)--genentech, a member of the roche group (six: ro, rog; otcqx: rhhby), announced today interim clinical data from the dose-finding parts of the pivotal firefish and sunfish studies investigating risdiplam (rg7916) in spinal muscular atrophy (sma). in the firefish study in type 1 sma, six out of 14 infants (43 percent) were able to sit (with or without support), including three (21 percent) who achieved unassisted stable sitting after eight months of treatment. in addition, four infants (29 percent) demonstrated rolling to the side; seven (50 percent) kicking and six (43 percent) achieved upright head control. these milestones were assessed according to the hammersmith infant neurological examination (hine) module 2 and are key secondary endpoints in the confirmatory part of firefish. “sma therapies that produce a sustained increase in smn protein in both the cns and periphery may provide comprehensive benefits to people diagnosed with sma, and we look forward to sharing additional data on risdiplam as the clinical program progresses.”tweet this the data were presented at the 23rd international annual congress of the world muscle society in mendoza, argentina. roche and genentech are leading the clinical development of risdiplam, an oral smn2 splicing modifier, as part of a collaboration with the sma foundation and ptc therapeutics. “we are highly encouraged by these data showing infants treated with risdiplam surviving and achieving developmental milestones beyond the natural history of this devastating disease,” said sandra horning, m.d., chief medical officer and head of global product development. “sma therapies that produce a sustained increase in smn protein in both the cns and periphery may provide comprehensive benefits to people diagnosed with sma, and we look forward to sharing additional data on risdiplam as the clinical program progresses.” updated analyses of the children's hospital of philadelphia infant test of neuromuscular disorders (chop-intend), a scale developed to assess motor function in infants with type 1 sma, demonstrated that eight out of 14 infants in firefish (57 percent) achieved a score of 40 or above at their eight-month visit. typically, an infant with type 1 sma does not demonstrate any motor improvement and can decline during this time period. the median chop-intend scores increased over time (37.5 at 6 months [n=20] compared to 41.5 at eight months [n=14]). the median age at first dose in firefish was 6.7 months and median treatment duration was 9.5 months. nineteen out of 21 infants enrolled (90 percent) remain alive with two having discontinued due to the fatal progression of their disease. three patients are now over 24 months old. no infant has required a tracheostomy or permanent ventilation since study initiation, and no infant has lost the ability to swallow. the most common adverse events were fever (pyrexia; 52.4 percent), diarrhea (26.8 percent), upper respiratory tract infections (19 percent), ear infections (14.3 percent), pneumonia (14.3 percent), constipation (14.3 percent), vomiting (14.3 percent), cough (14.3 percent) and upper respiratory tract inflammation (14.3 percent). in part 1 of the sunfish study in type 2 and 3 sma, smn protein median increases of greater than two-fold, as measured in blood, were seen after 12 months. a very broad patient population aged between two to 24 years was included, ranging in functional status from weak non-ambulant to strong ambulant, and with varying degrees of scoliosis from none to severe. twenty-one patients initially received lower doses of risdiplam for at least 12 weeks. of the patients treated with risdiplam for at least one year (n=30), the median change from baseline in motor function measure (mfm), the primary endpoint in the confirmatory part of sunfish and a scale used to assess motor function in neuromuscular diseases, was a 3.1-point improvement. sixty-three percent of patients experienced an improvement in mfm over baseline of three points or more after one year. such improvements were seen both in patients under 12 years old (76 percent; n=17) and over 12 years old (46 percent; n=13). when considering patients who experienced any amount of improvement over baseline, the percentages were 70 percent overall, 76 percent for the younger age group, and 62 percent for the older patients. serious adverse events that occurred in two or more of the 51 patients exposed to risdiplam were nausea (4 percent), upper respiratory tract infection (4 percent) and vomiting (4 percent). to date there have been no drug-related safety findings leading to withdrawal from any study. follow-up is ongoing for the confirmatory part 2 portions of both the firefish and sunfish studies. about sma spinal muscular atrophy (sma) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. it is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies. sma leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. depending on the type of sma, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost. sma is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (smn1) gene that results in a deficiency of smn protein. smn protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests sma is a multi-system disorder and the loss of smn protein may affect many tissues and cells throughout the body. about risdiplam risdiplam is an investigational, oral medicine that is systemically distributed and designed to increase smn protein levels in the central nervous system (cns) and throughout the body. it is designed to help the smn2 gene produce more functional smn protein, to better support motor neurons and muscle function. roche and genentech are leading the clinical development of risdiplam in collaboration with the sma foundation and ptc therapeutics. risdiplam is currently being evaluated in three multicenter trials in people with sma: firefish – an open-label trial in infants aged one to seven months with type 1 sma sunfish – a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in children and young adults (two to 25 years old) with type 2 and 3 sma jewelfish – an open-label exploratory trial in people aged 12–60 with type 2 or 3 sma who have been previously treated with smn-targeting therapy as part of a clinical study a new trial, rainbowfish in pre-symptomatic sma, will be initiated by early 2019. about firefish firefish is an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with type 1 sma. part 1 was a dose escalation study in 21 infants. the primary objective of part 1 was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for part 2. part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in approximately 40 infants with type 1 sma for 24 months, followed by an open-label extension. the primary objective of part 2 is to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the gross motor scale of the bayley scales of infant and toddler development – third edition (bsid-iii) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). about sunfish sunfish is a two-part double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal clinical trial in children and young adults (two to 25 years old) with type 2 and 3 sma. part 1 determined the dose for the confirmatory part 2, and enrollment in part 2 completed in september 2018. about genentech in neuroscience neuroscience is a major focus of research and development at genentech and roche. the company’s goal is to develop treatment options based on the biology of the nervous system to help improve the lives of people with chronic and potentially devastating diseases. genentech and roche have more than a dozen investigational medicines in clinical development for diseases that include multiple sclerosis, alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy, parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease and autism spectrum disorder. about genentech founded more than 40 years ago, genentech is a leading biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and commercializes medicines to treat patients with serious and life-threatening medical conditions. the company, a member of the roche group, has headquarters in south san francisco, california. for additional information about the company, please visit http://www.gene.com. \n",

believe is a phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study comparing luspatercept + best supportive care (bsc) versus placebo + bsc in adult beta-thalassemia patients who require regular rbc transfusions. the median age of the patients was 30 years in both treatment arms. 336 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg + bsc (224 patients) or placebo + bsc (112 patients) every 3 weeks for up to 48 weeks. patients in the luspatercept + bsc arm were able to be titrated up to 1.25 mg/kg of luspatercept every 3 weeks. bsc was defined as rbc transfusions and iron chelation therapy to maintain each patient’s baseline hemoglobin level. crossover to the luspatercept treatment group was allowed after unblinding and assessment by an independent data safety monitoring committee; patients receiving luspatercept + bsc will be followed for up to 3 years. the study was conducted at 65 sites in 15 countries. about luspatercept luspatercept is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent (ema) that is believed to regulate late-stage red blood cell maturation. acceleron and celgene are jointly developing luspatercept as part of a global collaboration. phase 3 clinical trials continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with mds (the medalist trial) and in patients with beta-thalassemia (the believe trial). a commands phase 3 trial in first-line, lower-risk, mds patients, the beyond phase 2 trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, and a phase 2 trial in myelofibrosis are

      "horizon pharma plc announces phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating teprotumumab (optic) for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease (ted) met primary and all secondary endpoints\n",
      "\n",
      " dublin--(business wire)--horizon pharma plc (nasdaq: hznp) today announced topline results from its phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating teprotumumab for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease (ted). the study met its primary endpoint, showing more patients treated with teprotumumab compared with placebo had a meaningful improvement in proptosis, or bulging of the eye: 82.9 percent of teprotumumab patients compared to 9.5 percent of placebo patients achieved the primary endpoint of a 2 mm or more reduction in proptosis (p<0.001). proptosis is the main cause of morbidity in ted. all secondary endpoints were also met and the safety profile was consistent with the phase 2 study of teprotumumab in ted. horizon expects to submit a biologics license application to the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) in mid-2019. teprotumumab has received breakthrough therapy, orphan drug and fast track designations from the fda. detailed phase 3 data will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a medical congress later this year. “the dramatic results of the teprotumumab phase 3 confirmatory trial, in addition to positive phase 2 data, form a highly convincing body of clinical evidence supporting teprotumumab for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease,” said timothy p. walbert, chairman, president and chief executive officer, horizon pharma plc. “this is a key milestone as we evolve into a research-focused company developing innovative new medicines to address challenging diseases with very few effective options. we are one step closer to delivering the first fda-approved treatment to people living with active thyroid eye disease, and we are grateful to the patients, physicians and investigational sites who have partnered with horizon to make the teprotumumab research and development program possible.” “in the study, patients treated with teprotumumab had an unprecedented reduction in proptosis, which is currently only treatable via surgery after the active disease has ended,” said raymond douglas, m.d., ph.d., the study’s co-principal investigator and director of the orbital and thyroid eye disease program, cedars-sinai medical center. “if approved, teprotumumab would give physicians the first medicine shown to reduce proptosis during active thyroid eye disease, in addition to treating other painful symptoms.” highlights from the phase 3 confirmatory trial, titled optic (treatment of graves’ orbitopathy (thyroid eye disease) to reduce proptosis with teprotumumab infusions in a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study): designed to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of teprotumumab in patients with active ted. eighty-three patients were assigned to receive teprotumumab or placebo in eight intravenous infusions (10mg/kg for their first infusion followed by 20mg/kg for the remaining seven infusions) every three weeks for 21 weeks. the primary endpoint was a responder rate of ≥ 2 mm reduction of proptosis in the study eye (without deterioration in the fellow eye) at week 24. in the intent-to-treat population, 34/41 (82.9%) patients receiving teprotumumab and 4/42 (9.5%) patients receiving placebo were proptosis responders at week 24 (p˂0.001). all secondary endpoints were also met (p≤0.001), which include the effect of teprotumumab vs. placebo on: overall responder rate at week 24 (primary endpoint in the phase 2 study): percent of participants with ≥2 point reduction in clinical activity score (cas) and ≥2 mm reduction in proptosis from baseline, provided there is no corresponding deterioration (≥2-point/mm increase) in cas or proptosis in the fellow eye. percent of participants with a cas value of 0 or 1 at week 24 in the study eye. percent of patients with a change from baseline of at least one grade in diplopia (double vision). mean change in proptosis measurement from baseline to week 24 in the study eye. mean change in graves’ ophthalmopathy quality of life from baseline to week 24. the safety profile of teprotumumab in optic was similar to that seen in the phase 2 study with no new safety observations. the drop-out rate was low (<5%) and balanced across placebo and treatment arms. there were no deaths during the study and a total of three serious adverse events: in the placebo arm, one patient had a visual field defect and received orbital decompression surgery and discontinued study; in the teprotumumab arm, one patient had pneumothorax (considered not related to study drug) and another had an infusion reaction that led to discontinuation of study drug. the vast majority of treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and no other adverse events resulted in discontinuation. ted is a progressive, debilitating autoimmune disease with a limited window of active disease during which it can be treated without surgical intervention.1,2 while ted often occurs in people living with hyperthyroidism or graves’ disease, it is a distinct disease that is caused by autoantigens activating an igf-1r-mediated signaling complex on cells within the orbit.3,4 this leads to a cascade of negative effects, which cause long-term, irreversible damage. active ted lasts for up to three years and is characterized by inflammation and tissue expansion behind the eye.5,1 as ted progresses, it causes serious damage – including proptosis (eye bulging), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes), and diplopia (double vision) – and in some cases can lead to blindness.2,6 currently, patients must suffer through active ted until the disease becomes inactive – often left with permanent and sight-impairing consequences – before they can have complex and costly surgical procedures that may never fully restore vision or appearance.5,1,7 people living with ted often experience long-term functional, psychological and economic burdens, including inability to work and perform activities of daily living.7,8 webcast at 8 a.m. et/1 p.m. ist today, the company will host a live webcast to discuss the results of the optic trial and current treatment landscape for ted. the live webcast and a replay may be accessed at http://ir.horizon-pharma.com. please connect to the company's website at least 15 minutes prior to the live webcast to ensure adequate time for any software download that may be needed to access the webcast. a replay of the webcast will be available approximately two hours after the live webcast. about teprotumumab teprotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mab) and a targeted inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf-1r). teprotumumab is an investigational medicine and its safety and efficacy have not been established. the phase 3 optic confirmatory clinical study was conducted at leading centers in the u.s., germany and italy, with co-principal investigators raymond douglas, m.d., ph.d., cedars-sinai medical center; and george kahaly, m.d., johannes gutenberg university medical center. in addition to the phase 3 optic trial, horizon is conducting the optic‐x extension trial to gather further insight into the long-term efficacy and safety of teprotumumab. the robust clinical development program for teprotumumab in the treatment of ted includes positive phase 2 results published in the new england journal of medicine. about horizon pharma plc horizon pharma plc is focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines that address unmet treatment needs for rare diseases, and rheumatic diseases, with a special interest for diseases for which a deep understanding of immunology may lead to innovative ways to control the disease. by fostering a growing pipeline of medicines in development and through aggressive life cycle management of our medicines, we strive to make a powerful difference for patients, their caregivers and physicians. for us, it’s personal: by living up to our own potential, we are helping others live up to theirs. for more information, please visit www.horizonpharma.com, follow us @hznpplc on twitter, like us on facebook or explore career opportunities on linkedin. forward-looking statements this press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding expectations regarding the submission of a bla for teprotumumab, expected publications and presentations of data from the phase 3 teprotumumab clinical trial, potential regulatory approval of teprotumumab and the potential for teprotumumab as a treatment for ted. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and horizon pharma does not undertake any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law. these forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions as of the date of this press release and actual results may differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. these factors include, but are not limited to, risks regarding whether horizon pharma experiences delays in submitting a bla for teprotumumab, whether the fda will accept the planned bla for filing or approve the bla, risks associated with clinical development of medicine candidates and whether horizon pharma will be able to successfully commercialize teprotumumab, if approved. for a further description of these and other risks facing horizon pharma, please see the risk factors described in horizon pharma's filings with the united states securities and exchange commission, including those factors discussed under the caption “risk factors” in those filings. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and horizon pharma undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law. references graves’ ophthalmopathy: visa versus eugogo classification, assessment, and management. journal of ophthalmology. 2015. https://www.hindawi.com/journals/joph/2015/249125/cta/. accessed feb 22, 2019. the 2016 european thyroid association/european group on graves' orbitopathy guidelines for the management of graves' orbitopathy. european thyroid journal. 2 march 2016. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099835. accessed feb 22, 2019. graves' ophthalmopathy. the new england journal of medicine. 25 february 2010. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra0905750. accessed feb 22, 2019. igs from patients with graves' disease induce the expression of t cell chemoattractants in their fibroblasts. the journal of immunology. 15 january 2002. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11777993. accessed feb 22, 2019. update on thyroid eye disease and management. clinical ophthalmology. 19 october 2009. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2770865/. accessed feb 22, 2019. clinical features of dysthyroid optic neuropathy: a european group on graves' orbitopathy (eugogo) survey. british journal of ophthalmology. 11 october 2006. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17035276. accessed feb 22, 2019. quality of life and occupational disability in endocrine orbitopathy. da international. 24 april 2009. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2689575/. accessed feb 22, 2019. public health relevance of graves' orbitopathy. the journal of clinical endocrinology & metabolism. 26 november 2012. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23185037. accessed feb 22, 2019. \n",

one-time treatment option. we look forward to the opportunity to continue the progress achieved by spark therapeutics for patients living with hemophilia b.”tweet this the phase 3 program was initiated following the transfer of the responsibility for spark therapeutics’ hemophilia b gene therapy program to pfizer. fidanacogene elaparvovec is a novel, investigational vector that contains a bio-engineered adeno-associated virus (aav) capsid (protein shell) and a high-activity human coagulation factor ix gene. it is hoped that, once treated, patients will be able to produce factor ix themselves, rather than having to regularly inject factor ix. \"with the lead-in study now open and actively recruiting patients, we are excited to begin our phase 3 program evaluating fidanacogene elaparvovec for the treatment of hemophilia b,” said brenda cooperstone, md, senior vice president and chief development officer, rare disease, pfizer global product development. “the current data suggest immense promise for the use of this potential one-time treatment option. we look forward to the opportunity to continue the progress achieved by spark therapeutics for patients living with hemophilia b.” “we are pleased to have transitioned fidanacogene elaparvovec to pfizer following the positive results of the ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial,” said katherine a. high, md, president and head of research & development, spark therapeutics. “the initiation of the phase 3 program marks an important milestone toward our goal of one day potentially freeing patients with hemophilia b of the need for regular infusions, while potentially eliminating spontaneous bleeding.” in may 2018, pfizer and spark therapeutics announced data for 15 participants in the ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial of fidanacogene elaparvovec for the treatment of severe or moderately severe (fix:c < 2 percent) hemophilia b. the findings showed all 15 patients had discontinued routine infusions of factor ix concentrates with no reported serious adverse events or thrombotic events as of the may 7, 2018 data cutoff. about the pfizer and spark therapeutics agreement pfizer and spark therapeutics entered into a license agreement in december 2014 for the hemophilia b gene therapy program. under the terms of the agreement, pfizer will now assume sole responsibility for all subsequent pivotal studies, all regulatory activities, manufacturing and global commercialization of any products resulting from the hemophilia b gene therapy program. about hemophilia b hemophilia, a rare genetic bleeding disorder that causes the blood to take a long time to clot because of a deficiency in one of several blood clotting factors, is almost exclusively found in males. people with hemophilia are at risk for excessive and recurrent bleeding from modest injuries, which have the potential to be life threatening. people with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints, or rarely into other critical closed spaces such as the intracranial space, where bleeding can be fatal. the incidence of hemophilia b is one in 25,000 male births. people with hemophilia b have a deficiency in clotting factor ix, a specific protein in the blood. hemophilia b also is called congenital factor ix deficiency or christmas disease. the current standard of care requires recurrent intravenous infusions of either plasma-derived or recombinant factor ix to control and prevent bleeding episodes. there exists a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat people living with hemophilia. pfizer rare disease rare disease includes some of the most serious of all illnesses and impacts millions of patients worldwide, representing an opportunity to apply our knowledge and

      "\n",
      " concord, calif.--(business wire)--cerus corporation (nasdaq: cers) announced today that baylor st. luke’s medical center in houston became the first center in the continental u.s. to enroll patients in cerus’ redes study. redes is a phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intercept blood systems for red blood cells (rbcs) compared to conventional rbcs in regions impacted by the zika virus. “the risk of zika transmission through blood transfusions remains a key concern in states along the gulf coast such as texas given the prevalence of the aedes mosquito, a known vector for several viruses.”tweet this “we are pleased to be part of this very important study,” said dr. elizabeth hartwell, clinical pathologist and principal investigator for redes at baylor st. luke’s medical center. “the risk of zika transmission through blood transfusions remains a key concern in states along the gulf coast such as texas given the prevalence of the aedes mosquito, a known vector for several viruses.” based on provisional data from the cdc, in 2017 there were 49 symptomatic cases of zika reported in texas. in addition, blood screening tests identified two individuals in texas as presumptive viremic blood donors. while the majority of zika cases were reported by travelers returning from affected areas, three cases in 2017 were presumed to be transmitted through local mosquitos. “expansion of redes into the continental u.s. is a key step in moving our u.s. red cell program forward. in addition to baylor st. luke’s, we expect several more sites to begin enrolling patients in the coming months. with the addition of these new sites, we expect to see the rate of enrollment in the study accelerate,” said dr. richard benjamin, cerus’ chief medical officer. redes is a two-stage study being conducted in regions impacted by the zika virus epidemic. the first stage of the trial is a double-blind, controlled, parallel group trial where 600 adult patients will be randomized to receive up to 28 days of transfusion support with intercept-treated rbcs or conventional rbcs, with a primary endpoint of hemoglobin increment following transfusion. in a second optional stage, up to 20,000 patients would receive rbc transfusion support with up to 50,000 rbc units in an open-label, single-arm treatment use study. the objective of the second stage is to provide early access to the intercept blood system for rbcs in regions where a substantial proportion of the population has been infected or is at risk of infection by the zika virus, or future similar mosquito-borne epidemics, and the risk of asymptomatic infection among qualified blood donors is recognized. the study is funded as part of an agreement with the biomedical advanced research and development authority (barda), part of the u.s. department of health and human services’ office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. about cerus cerus corporation is a biomedical products company focused in the field of blood transfusion safety. the intercept blood system is designed to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections by inactivating a broad range of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and parasites that may be present in donated blood. the nucleic acid targeting mechanism of action of the intercept treatment is designed to inactivate established transfusion threats, such as hepatitis b and c, hiv, west nile virus and bacteria, as well as emerging pathogens such as chikungunya, malaria and dengue. cerus currently markets and sells the intercept blood system for both platelets and plasma in the united states, europe, the commonwealth of independent states, the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world. the intercept red blood cell system is in clinical development. see http://www.cerus.com for information about cerus. intercept and the intercept blood system are trademarks of cerus corporation. forward-looking statements this press release contains forward-looking statements. any statements contained in this press release that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements concerning cerus‘ expectations for new site enrollment and increased rate of enrollment for the redes study. actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, without limitation: risks that successful enrollment at redes study sites may be delayed, or may not increase at the expected rate or at all, as well as other risks detailed in cerus’ filings with the securities and exchange commission, including cerus’ annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017, filed with the sec on march 8, 2018. cerus disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release. \n",

      "acorda announces the lancet neurology publication of phase 3 data for inbrija™ (levodopa inhalation powder)\n",
      "\n",
      " ardsley, n.y.--(business wire)--acorda therapeutics, inc. (nasdaq:acor) today announced that the lancet neurology published results from span℠-pd, the phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial of inbrija™ (levodopa inhalation powder), also referred to as cvt-301. in the study, inbrija 84 mg significantly improved motor function at 30 minutes during off periods in people with parkinson’s taking carbidopa/levodopa, the study’s primary endpoint. onset of action was seen as early as 10 minutes and the reduction at 30 minutes was maintained at 60 minutes. multiple secondary endpoints were supportive of the primary endpoint. data from the study were first presented at the 2017 international congress of parkinson’s disease and movement disorders (mds). “the data published in the lancet neurology support inbrija as such a treatment option, delivering levodopa, the current ‘gold standard’ of parkinson’s treatment, in a novel, inhaled form.”tweet this “a well-tolerated, effective treatment for off periods between doses of scheduled medications can help fulfill one of the most important unmet needs for people with parkinson’s,” said lead author of the publication peter lewitt, m.d., director of the parkinson’s disease and movement disorders program at henry ford hospital and professor of neurology at wayne state university school of medicine. “the data published in the lancet neurology support inbrija as such a treatment option, delivering levodopa, the current ‘gold standard’ of parkinson’s treatment, in a novel, inhaled form.” “we’re gratified to see the span-pd trial paper published in one of the most highly regarded neurology journals, the lancet neurology. we believe this reflects both the quality of the study and the importance of its clinical results to people with parkinson’s,” said ron cohen, m.d., acorda’s president and ceo. “inbrija was recently approved by the fda, and we are eager to make it available to the parkinson’s community during the first quarter of 2019.” about span℠-pd (nct02240030) and key results the phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial for inbrija – span-pd – was a 12-week, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study evaluating the effectiveness of inbrija versus placebo in patients with parkinson’s experiencing off periods. the 339 patients in the trial had mild to moderate parkinson’s and were on an oral levodopa plus a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa). most were on additional scheduled parkinson’s medication and were experiencing at least two hours per day of off time. patients with asthma, copd, or other chronic lung disease within the previous five years were excluded. patients were randomized into three treatment groups: 113 in the inbrija 60 mg group, 114 in the inbrija 84 mg group and 112 with placebo. the primary endpoint was the change in the unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (updrs) motor scores from pre-dose to 30 minutes post-dose, evaluated at week 12 during an in-clinic off period. inbrija 84 mg showed statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to placebo as measured by mean change in the updrs motor score at 30 minutes post-dose (-9.83 vs. -5.91; p=0.0088). key secondary endpoints for inbrija versus placebo also were evaluated at week 12 using a pre-specified hierarchy. the order of hierarchy was set based on probability of success, guided by a phase 2 study. the primary endpoint (inbrija 84 mg vs. placebo) was tested first for statistical significance. upon achieving significance, the secondary endpoints were tested for inbrija 84 mg vs. placebo as long as each preceding endpoint reached a significance level of p<0.05. the hierarchical sequence did not reach statistical significance at step 3. unadjusted (nominal) p-values are presented below for all key secondary endpoints. endpoint hierarchy order ∆ p-value 84 mg vs. placebo change in updrs motor score at 30 min, ls mean (primary) 1 -3.92 0.0088** % off to on and remaining on at 60 min, odds ratio 2 2.65 0.003** change in updrs motor score at 20 min, ls mean 3 -2.55 0.062 % subjects improved on patient global impression of change, odds ratio 4 2.94 <0.001* change in updrs motor score at 10 min, ls mean 5 -2.26 0.046* change in parkinson’s disease diary off-state time, ls mean 6 -0.01 0.975 ** statistically significant on a nominal and adjusted basis * nominal p-value; not eligible for statistical significance. reported adverse events in at least 4% of patients in the inbrija 84 mg group vs. placebo were: cough (15% vs. 2%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 3%), nausea (5% vs. 3%), discolored sputum (5% vs. 0%) and dyskinesia (4% vs. 0%). most adverse events of cough in the inbrija treatment groups started within the first 30 days of treatment, and these were generally assessed as mild or moderate in intensity. two patients in the inbrija 84 mg group withdrew from the study due to cough. about inbrija™ (levodopa inhalation powder) inbrija is the first and only inhaled levodopa for intermittent treatment of off episodes in patients with parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. inbrija utilizes acorda’s innovative arcus® platform for inhaled therapeutics. a marketing authorization application (maa) for inbrija was submitted to the european medicines agency (ema) in march 2018 and was formally validated in may 2018. important safety information inbrija is not to be used if patients take or have taken a nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor such as phenelzine or tranylcypromine within the last 2 weeks. before using inbrija, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all their medical conditions, including: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), or any chronic lung disease daytime sleepiness from a sleep disorder or if they get drowsy/sleepy without warning or take a medicine that increases sleepiness such as sleep medicines, antidepressants, or antipsychotics feel dizzy, nausea, sweaty, or faint when standing from sitting/lying down history of abnormal movement (dyskinesia) mental health problem such as hallucinations or psychosis uncontrollable urges (for example, gambling, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, or binge eating) glaucoma pregnancy or plans to become pregnant. it is not known if inbrija will harm an unborn baby. breastfeeding or plans to breastfeed. levodopa (the medicine in inbrija) can pass into breastmilk and it is unknown if it can harm the baby. patients should tell their healthcare provider if they take: mao-b inhibitors dopamine d2 receptor antagonists (including phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, metoclopramide), or isoniazid iron salts or multivitamins that contain iron salts no more than 1 dose (2 capsules) should be taken for any off period. no more than 5 doses (10 capsules) of inbrija should be taken in a day. inbrija is for oral inhalation only. inbrija capsules are not to be swallowed or opened. patients are not to drive, operate machinery, or do other activities until they know how inbrija affects them. sleepiness and falling asleep suddenly can happen as late as a year after treatment is started. inbrija can cause serious side effects including the following. patients should tell their healthcare provider if they experience them: falling asleep during normal daily activities (such as driving, doing physical tasks, using hazardous machinery, talking, or eating) which can be without warning. if patients become drowsy while using inbrija, they should not drive or do activities where they need to be alert. chances of falling asleep during normal activities increases if patients take medicines that cause sleepiness. withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion (symptoms including fever, confusion, stiff muscles, and changes in breathing and heartbeat) in patients who suddenly lower or change their dose or stop using inbrija or carbidopa/levodopa medicines. low blood pressure with or without dizziness, fainting, nausea, and sweating. patients should get up slowly after sitting or lying down. hallucinations and other psychosis – inbrija may cause or worsen psychotic symptoms including hallucinations (seeing/hearing things that are not real); confusion, disorientation, or disorganized thinking; trouble sleeping; dreaming a lot; being overly suspicious or feeling people want to harm them; believing things that are not real, acting aggressive, and feeling agitated/restless. unusual uncontrollable urges such as gambling, binge eating, shopping, and sexual urges has occurred in some people using medicines like inbrija. uncontrolled, sudden body movements (dyskinesia) may be caused or worsened by inbrija. inbrija may need to be stopped or other parkinson’s medicines may need to be changed. bronchospasm – people with asthma, copd, or other lung diseases may wheeze or have difficulty breathing after inhaling inbrija. if patients have these symptoms, they should stop taking inbrija and call their healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. increased eye pressure in patients with glaucoma. healthcare providers should monitor this. changes in certain lab values including liver tests the most common side effects of inbrija include cough, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and change in the color of saliva or spit. please see the accompanying full prescribing information available at www.inbrija.com/prescribing-information.pdf. about parkinson’s and off periods parkinson’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons. these neurons are responsible for producing dopamine and that loss causes a range of symptoms including impaired movement, muscle stiffness and tremors as parkinson’s progresses, people are likely to experience off periods, which are characterized by the return of parkinson’s symptoms, which can occur despite underlying baseline therapy. approximately one million people in the u.s. and 1.2 million europeans are diagnosed with parkinson’s; it is estimated that approximately 40 percent of people with parkinson’s in the u.s. experience off periods. about arcus® technology platform the arcus technology platform allows systemic delivery of medication through inhalation, by transforming molecules into a light, porous dry powder. this allows delivery of substantially higher doses of medication than can be delivered via conventional dry powder technologies. arcus has the potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. acorda acquired the arcus technology platform as part of the acquisition of civitas therapeutics in 2014. about acorda therapeutics acorda therapeutics develops therapies to restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. inbrija™ (levodopa inhalation powder) is approved for intermittent treatment of off episodes in patients with parkinson’s treated with carbidopa/levodopa. inbrija utilizes acorda’s innovative arcus® pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation. acorda also markets the branded ampyra® (dalfampridine) extended release tablets, 10 mg. forward-looking statement this press release includes forward-looking statements. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, regarding management's expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects should be considered forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including: we may not be able to successfully market inbrija or any other products under development; risks associated with complex, regulated manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals, which could affect whether we have sufficient commercial supply of inbrija to meet market demand; third party payers (including governmental agencies) may not reimburse for the use of inbrija or our other products at acceptable rates or at all and may impose restrictive prior authorization requirements that limit or block prescriptions; competition for inbrija, ampyra and other products we may develop and market in the future, including increasing competition and accompanying loss of revenues in the u.s. from generic versions of ampyra (dalfampridine) following our loss of patent exclusivity;

      "immunogen announces successful completion of interim analysis for forward i phase 3 trial of mirvetuximab soravtansine in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer\n",
      "\n",
      " waltham, mass.--(business wire)--immunogen, inc. (nasdaq: imgn), a leader in the expanding field of antibody-drug conjugates (adcs) for the treatment of cancer, today announced that the forward i phase 3 registration trial evaluating mirvetuximab soravtansine as a single-agent therapy for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer will continue as planned without modification. the decision follows a recommendation by the independent data monitoring committee (idmc) based upon successful completion of a pre-specified interim futility analysis after 80 progression-free survival (pfs) events as determined by blinded, independent central review. immunogen has also completed full enrollment of the trial two months ahead of schedule and expects top-line results from forward i during the first half of 2019. “ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancers, and patients diagnosed with this life-threatening disease have limited treatment options, especially once they develop platinum-resistant disease”tweet this “ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancers, and patients diagnosed with this life-threatening disease have limited treatment options, especially once they develop platinum-resistant disease,” said anna berkenblit, m.d., vice president and chief medical officer of immunogen. “we are encouraged that the idmc recommended forward i proceed as planned and are pleased that the trial has reached full enrollment earlier than expected. we look forward to assessing top-line data in the first half of 2019.” forward i is an ongoing phase 3 trial designed to randomize 333 patients 2:1 to receive either mirvetuximab soravtansine or the physician's choice of single-agent chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, or weekly paclitaxel). eligibility criteria include patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer that express medium or high levels of folate receptor alpha (frα) who have been treated with up to three prior regimens. the primary endpoint of this study is pfs, which is being assessed in the entire study population and in the subset of patients with high frα expression. enrollment was initially planned to be completed by the end of june. immunogen is partnering with the gynecologic oncology group foundation inc., a leader in clinical research in gynecologic malignancies, on forward i, which is being conducted in north america and europe. this trial is intended to support full marketing approval of mirvetuximab soravtansine for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. about mirvetuximab soravtansinemirvetuximab soravtansine (imgn853) is the first frα-targeting adc. it uses a humanized frα-binding antibody to target the adc specifically to frα-expressing cancer cells and a potent anti-tumor agent, dm4, to kill these targeted cancer cells. mirvetuximab is also being assessed in combination regimens for both platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive disease in the phase 1b/2 forward ii trial. about ovarian cancer and frαit is estimated that 22,000 women are diagnosed annually with ovarian cancer in the us. with more than 14,000 deaths each year, ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.1 standard first-line therapy for ovarian cancer is a platinum-based combination regimen. once the cancer becomes platinum-resistant, treatment options include single-agent cytotoxic therapies such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or topotecan, and combination therapies that include avastin®. there is a significant need for more effective, better-tolerated therapies for recurrent ovarian cancer. it is estimated that approximately 19,000 women in the us and approximately 24,000 women in the eu have platinum-resistant ovarian cancer requiring second-line or later treatment.2 immunogen estimates that 60% of ovarian cancer cases have medium or high frα expression. about immunogen, inc.immunogen is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops targeted cancer therapeutics using its proprietary adc technology. the company’s lead product candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine, is in the forward i phase 3 trial for frα-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and is in the forward ii phase 1b/2 trial in combination regimens for earlier-stage disease. immunogen has three additional clinical-stage product candidates, two of which are being developed in collaboration with jazz pharmaceuticals. immunogen's adc technology is also used in roche's marketed product, kadcyla®, and in programs in development by amgen, bayer, biotest, cytomx, debiopharm, lilly, novartis, sanofi and takeda. more information about the company can be found at www.immunogen.com. kadcyla® is a registered trademark of genentech, a member of the roche group. 1american cancer society. cancer facts & figures 2018. atlanta, ga: american cancer society;

      " cambridge, mass.--(business wire)--ironwood pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq:irwd), a gi-focused healthcare company, today announced the initiation of patient dosing in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating md-7246 in patients with abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (ibs-d). data from the phase ii trial are expected in the second half of 2020. “abdominal pain is a dominant symptom experienced by approximately 16 million people in the u.s. living with ibs-d, and there are a limited number of treatment options for patients seeking effective pain relief”tweet this ironwood and allergan are evaluating md-7246, an investigational new product, as an oral, intestinal, non-opioid, pain-relieving agent for patients suffering from abdominal pain associated with certain gi diseases. md-7246 is a delayed-release formulation of linaclotide designed to provide targeted delivery of linaclotide to the colon, where the majority of the abdominal pain associated with ibs-d is believed to originate, and to limit fluid secretion in the small intestine resulting in minimal impact on bowel function. “abdominal pain is a dominant symptom experienced by approximately 16 million people in the u.s. living with ibs-d, and there are a limited number of treatment options for patients seeking effective pain relief,” said michael shetzline, m.d., ph.d., chief medical officer, senior vice president and head of drug development at ironwood. “through its delayed release and differentiated mechanism of action, we believe that md-7246 has the potential to target abdominal pain in patients with ibs-d and look forward to advancing it as a potential abdominal pain-relieving agent for this population. if successful, we hope to explore the broader potential of md-7246 for the more than 50 million patients estimated to suffer from recurring abdominal pain across a broader range of gi disorders.” the phase ii trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-range-finding, 12-week study. it is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, treatment effect on abdominal pain, and dose response of md-7246 administered orally to patients with abdominal pain associated with ibs-d. the study is expected to enroll approximately 400 ibs-d patients who are randomized equally across three dose levels of md-7246 (300, 600 or 1,200 mcg), or matching placebo, administered once daily. data from an earlier phase iib trial in patients with ibs with constipation (ibs-c) showed that md-7246, as intended, numerically improved abdominal pain relative to placebo, with no apparent effect on bowel movement function. about ibs-dapproximately 16 million patients suffer from ibs-d in the united states. 1,2 these patients report frequent abdominal pain (approximately 86 days of the year), discomfort and bloating, along with stools that are more loose or frequent than usual. 3 more than 80% of surveyed patients report ibs-d symptoms as somewhat to extremely severe.4 about md-7246md-7246 is a delayed release formulation of linaclotide being evaluated by ironwood and its partner allergan plc as an oral, non-opioid, pain-relieving agent for patients in the u.s. suffering from abdominal pain associated with ibs with diarrhea (ibs-d). linaclotide is thought to work in two different ways, based on non-clinical studies: by increasing fluid secretion into the intestine and by decreasing the activity of pain-sensing nerves. md-7246 is designed to provide targeted delivery of linaclotide to the colon, where the majority of the abdominal pain associated with ibs-d is believed to originate, and to limit fluid secretion in the small intestine resulting in minimal impact on bowel function. ironwood and allergan have issued patents and pending patent applications covering md-7246 that are expected to provide patent coverage into the mid-2030s. about ironwood pharmaceuticalsironwood pharmaceuticals (nasdaq:irwd) is a gi-focused healthcare company dedicated to creating medicines that make a difference for patients living with gi diseases. we discovered, developed and are commercializing linaclotide, the u.s. branded prescription market leader for adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (ibs-c) or chronic idiopathic constipation (cic). we are currently advancing a phase iiib trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of linaclotide on multiple abdominal symptoms, including bloating, pain, and discomfort, in adult patients with ibs-c. we are also advancing two late-stage, first-in-category gi product candidates: iw-3718 is a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant being developed for the potential treatment of persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease, and md-7246 is a delayed-release formulation of linaclotide that is being evaluated as an oral, intestinal, non-opioid, pain-relieving agent for patients suffering from abdominal pain associated with ibs with diarrhea. ironwood was founded in 1998 and is

      "exelixis and its partner ipsen announce positive overall survival results from subgroup analyses of phase 3 trial of cabometyx™ (cabozantinib) tablets in advanced renal cell carcinoma at 2016 asco annual meeting\n",
      "\n",
      " paris & south san francisco, calif.--(business wire)--regulatory news: “these findings demonstrate that the benefit of cabometyx™ for patients was robust and consistent regardless of prior treatment, location and extent of tumor metastases”tweet this exelixis, inc. (nasdaq:exel) and ipsen (euronext: ipn; adr: ipsey) today announced the presentation of positive data from subgroup analyses of the pivotal meteor trial comparing cabometyx™ (cabozantinib) tablets with everolimus in 658 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (rcc) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. the data will be presented in two posters today at the 2016 american society of clinical oncology (asco) annual meeting, which is being held june 3-7 in chicago, by bernard escudier, m.d., chair, genitourinary oncology committee, institut gustave roussy and thomas powles, m.d., clinical professor of genitourinary oncology, barts cancer institute. the findings demonstrate that benefits of cabometyx™ in progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) were independent of the presence of bone metastases, prior anti-pd-1/pd-l1 therapy, and the type of prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) therapy. “these additional analyses demonstrate the value of cabometyx™ for advanced kidney cancer, showing consistent improvement in pfs and os across multiple subgroups of patients in the meteor trial,” said michael m. morrissey, ph.d., president and chief executive officer of exelixis. “we are dedicated to exploring the full potential of cabometyx™ to help as many patients as possible.” in the first of the two presentations, treatment with cabometyx™ was associated with improved pfs and os in patients who had bone metastases at baseline (n=142). median pfs was 7.4 months with cabometyx™ versus 2.7 months with everolimus (hr=0.33, 95% ci 0.21-0.51), and median os was 20.1 months versus 12.1 months, respectively (hr=0.54, 95% ci 0.34-0.84). for patients who had both bone and visceral metastases (n=112), median pfs was 5.6 months with cabometyx™ and 1.9 months with everolimus (hr=0.26, 95% ci 0.16-0.43). median os was 20.1 months versus 10.7 months, respectively (hr=0.45, 95% ci 0.28-0.72). the safety profile of cabometyx™ for the subgroup with bone metastases was consistent with that of the overall meteor trial. “patients whose kidney cancer has spread to their bones traditionally have a poorer prognosis and worse treatment outcomes compared with those who do not have bone involvement,” said dr. escudier. “cabometyx™ demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit for those with bone metastases, which is encouraging for physicians and patients who are seeking additional therapeutic options.” in the second presentation, outcomes were evaluated based on the prior therapy patients had received before entering the meteor trial. os and pfs benefits were consistent across all subgroups evaluated (see table below), including number of prior vegfr tkis (one or more than one), specific prior vegfr tki (sunitinib or pazopanib) in patients who had only one prior vegfr tki therapy, and prior treatment with anti-pd-1/pd-l1 therapies. adverse events in the treatment subgroups were similar to those in the overall study population and were managed with dose reductions. table. os and pfs in meteor by subgroup subgroup n median os (months) oshazardratio (95% ci) median pfs

benefit of cabometyx™ for patients was robust and consistent regardless of prior treatment, location and extent of tumor metastases,” said marc de garidel, chairman and chief executive officer, ipsen. on april 25, 2016 cabometyx™ was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of patients with advanced rcc who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. cabometyx™, which was granted fast track and breakthrough therapy designations by the fda, is the first approved single agent therapy to demonstrate, in a phase 3 trial for patients with advanced rcc, robust and clinically meaningful improvements in all three key efficacy parameters — os, pfs and objective response rate. about the meteor phase 3 pivotal trial meteor was an open-label, event-driven trial of 658 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who had failed at least one prior vegfr tki therapy. the primary endpoint was pfs in the first 375 patients treated. secondary endpoints included os and objective response rate in all enrolled patients. the trial was conducted at approximately 200 sites in 26 countries, and enrollment was weighted toward western europe, north america, and australia. patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 60 mg of cabometyx™ daily or 10 mg of everolimus daily and were stratified based on the number of prior vegfr tki therapies received and on mskcc risk criteria. no cross-over was allowed between the study arms. meteor met its primary endpoint of significantly improving pfs. compared with everolimus, cabometyx™ was associated with a 42 percent reduction in the rate of disease progression or death. median pfs for cabometyx™ was 7.4 months versus 3.8 months for everolimus (hr=0.58, 95% ci 0.45-0.74, p<0.0001). cabometyx™ also significantly improved the objective response rate compared with everolimus (p<0.0001). these data were presented at the european cancer congress in september 2015 and published in the new england journal of medicine.1 cabometyx™ also demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful increase in os in the meteor trial. compared with everolimus, cabometyx™ was associated with a 34 percent reduction in the rate of death. median os was 21.4 months for patients receiving cabometyx™ versus 16.5 months for those receiving everolimus (hr=0.66, 95% ci 0.53-0.83, p=0.0003). cabozantinib benefit in os was robust and consistent across all pre-specified subgroups. in particular, benefit was observed regardless of risk category, location and extent of tumor metastases, and tumor met expression level. these results were presented on june 5, 2016 at the asco annual meeting and concurrently published in the lancet oncology.2 at the time of the analysis, the median duration of treatment in the trial was 8.3 months with cabometyx™ versus 4.4 months with everolimus. dose reductions occurred for 62 percent and 25 percent of patients, respectively. discontinuation rate due to an adverse event not related to disease progression was 12 percent with cabometyx™ and 11 percent with everolimus. about advanced renal cell carcinoma the american cancer society’s 2016 statistics cite kidney cancer as among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the u.s.3 clear cell rcc is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults.4 if detected in its early stages, the five-year survival rate for rcc is high; for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic rcc, however, the five-year survival rate is only 12 percent, with no identified cure for the disease.3 approximately 17,000 patients in the u.s. and 37,000 globally require second-line or later treatment.5 the majority of clear cell rcc tumors have lower than normal levels of a protein called von hippel-lindau, which leads to higher levels of met, axl and vegf.6,7 these proteins promote tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel growth), growth, invasiveness and metastasis.8-11 met and axl may provide escape pathways that drive resistance to vegfr inhibitors.7,8 about cabometyx™ cabometyx™ targets include met, axl and vegfr-1, -2 and -3. in preclinical models, cabozantinib has been shown to inhibit the activity of these receptors, which are involved in normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, metastasis and drug resistance. cabometyx™, the tablet formulation of cabozantinib, is available in 20 mg, 40 mg or 60 mg doses. the recommended dose is 60 mg orally, once daily. on april 25, 2016, the fda approved cabometyx™ tablets for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. on january 28, 2016, the european medicines agency (ema) validated exelixis’ marketing authorization application (maa) for cabozantinib as a treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received one prior therapy. the maa has been granted accelerated assessment, making it eligible for a 150-day review, versus the standard 210 days. on february 29, 2016, exelixis and ipsen jointly announced an exclusive licensing agreement for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib indications outside of the united states, canada and japan. references 1. choueiri tk, escudier b, powles t, et al. cabozantinib versus everolimus in advanced renal-cell

general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the group’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. the group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the group’s activities and financial results. the group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. it might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. a default by any of the group’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. such situations could have a negative impact on the group’s business, financial position or performance. the group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. the group’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the french autorité des marchés financiers. the risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the group’s 2014 registration document available on its website (www.ipsen.com). \n",

      "cerus presents results of european phase 3 chronic anemia study at the 23rd congress of european hematology association\n",
      "\n",
      " concord, calif.--(business wire)--cerus corporation (nasdaq: cers) announced that results from sparc, the company’s european phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of intercept-treated red blood cells (rbcs) in thalassemia major patients, were presented today at the 23rd congress of european hematology association (eha) in stockholm sweden in a poster presentation entitled, “a randomized, controlled, phase iii study to evaluate s-303/glutathione pathogen-inactivated red blood cells in thalassemia major patients (sparc).” thalassemia major patients require life-long rbc transfusions to prevent bone marrow expansion and correct anemia but may impact iron (fe) balance and the need for chelation therapy. hemoglobin (hb) consumption (grams/kg/day) is an important measure of clinical efficacy because each gram of hb carries a burden of 3.5mg of fe. “patients in need of chronic transfusions of red blood cells are at elevated risk of transfusion transmitted infections (tti) from existing and emerging pathogens. we believe the intercept-treated rbcs have the potential to reduce the risk of tti and improve patient care.”tweet this “we are pleased to present these data from the sparc study at eha, one of the premier scientific meetings targeted at the european hematology community,” said dr. richard benjamin, cerus’ chief medical officer. “patients in need of chronic transfusions of red blood cells are at elevated risk of transfusion transmitted infections (tti) from existing and emerging pathogens. we believe the intercept-treated rbcs have the potential to reduce the risk of tti and improve patient care.” sparc was a randomized, controlled, double blinded non-inferiority study. subjects were randomized to sequential treatment periods of intercept-treated rbcs and conventional rbcs with cross over to the other treatment upon completion of the first treatment period. each treatment period consisted of six transfusion episodes over approximately 5 to 6 months. patients maintained their targeted transfusion threshold as medically indicated before and during the study period. the primary efficacy endpoint was red blood cell hb consumption over four transfusion episodes in each treatment period expressed as the total hb mass transfused per subject, adjusted for body weight and time. the pre-determined non-inferiority margin was 15%. the primary safety endpoint was treatment-emergent antibodies with confirmed specificity to intercept-treated rbc. patients were enrolled at two sites in italy and one site in turkey. a total of 81 patients with a mean age of 26.1 ± 8.1 years (range 10-44) were transfused. on an intent-to-treat basis, total mean hb consumption in the evaluation period was 0.113 ± 0.04 g/kg/day in the intercpt arm compared to 0.111 ± 0.04 g/kg/day in the control arm. the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved, with a mean treatment difference of 0.002 g/kg/day (1.8%), well below the pre-determined 15% inferiority margin (<0.017g/kg/day). the primary safety endpoint also was achieved with no treatment emergent antibodies with confirmed specificity to intercept-treated rbcs or rbc antigens. adverse events were balanced between test and control periods. there were no deaths, grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) adverse events, or events deemed certain or likely related to intercept-treated rbcs. about cerus cerus corporation is a biomedical products company focused in the field of blood transfusion safety. the intercept blood system is designed to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections by inactivating a broad range of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and parasites that may be present in donated blood. the nucleic acid targeting mechanism of action of the intercept treatment is designed to inactivate established transfusion threats, such as hepatitis b and c, hiv, west nile virus and bacteria, as well as emerging pathogens such as chikungunya, malaria and dengue. cerus currently markets and sells the intercept blood system for both platelets and plasma in the united states, europe, the commonwealth of independent states, the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world. the intercept red blood cell system is in clinical development. see http://www.cerus.com for information about cerus. intercept and the intercept blood system are trademarks of cerus corporation. \n",

      "arrowhead pharmaceuticals begins dosing in phase 1 study of aro-apoc3 for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia\n",
      "\n",
      " pasadena, calif.--(business wire)--arrowhead pharmaceuticals inc. (nasdaq: arwr) today announced that it has dosed the first subjects in a phase 1 clinical study of aro-apoc3, an rnai-based investigational medicine targeting apolipoprotein c-iii (apoc-iii) being developed for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. bruce given, m.d., chief operating officer and head of r&d at arrowhead, said: “patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, and particularly patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or fcs, do not have adequate treatment options. due to its activity as a triglyceride regulator, apoc-iii has the potential to be an important therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease. the design of the aro-apoc3 phase 1 study is intended to provide a readout on safety and tolerability, as well as a robust view of the pharmacologic activity and duration of effect. aro-apoc3 is arrowhead’s second cardiometabolic candidate to enter clinical studies this year, following aro-ang3 for the treatment of dyslipidemias and metabolic diseases. it also represents the fifth clinical stage rnai therapeutic derived from our proprietary targeted rnai molecule, or trimtm, platform.” aroapoc31001 (nct03783377) is a phase 1 single and multiple dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of aro-apoc3 in adult healthy volunteers, hypertriglyceridemic patients, and patients with fcs. the study is designed to enroll up to 63 subjects. the single-ascending dose (sad) portion of the study is designed to include 4 cohorts of 10 adult healthy volunteers with elevated triglycerides. each sad subject will receive a single-dose administration of either placebo or aro-apoc3 at dose levels of 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg. the multiple-dose portion is designed to include 3 cohorts of patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and 1 cohort of patients with fcs. the multiple-dose cohorts will receive two monthly doses of aro-apoc3. apoc-iii has emerged as a therapeutic target for triglyceride reduction. apoc-iii regulates triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (trls) and is a known inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (lpl) activity and lpl-mediated lipolysis of trls. apoc-iii also delays the clearance of lipoprotein remnants by the liver by inhibiting hepatocyte receptor-mediated uptake. human genetic studies indicate that people with apoc-iii loss-of-function mutations show reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, with reductions in plasma triglycerides levels, while appearing to be phenotypically normal. fcs is a severe rare genetic disease, with a prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000, and is often caused by single gene mutations that lead to extremely high triglyceride levels, typically over 900 mg/dl, representing the top 0.1% of triglyceride values measured. such severe elevations lead to various serious signs and symptoms, including acute pancreatitis, which can be fatal, chronic daily abdominal pain, type ii diabetes mellitus, hepatic steatosis, and cognitive issues. there is no currently available therapy that can adequately treat fcs. about arrowhead pharmaceuticals arrowhead pharmaceuticals develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. using a broad portfolio of rna chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, arrowhead therapies trigger the rna interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep, and durable knockdown of target genes. rna interference, or rnai, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. arrowhead’s rnai-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing. for more information, please visit www.arrowheadpharma.com, or follow us on twitter @arrowheadpharma. to

      "deciphera pharmaceuticals announces positive, preliminary, top-line clinical data for the ongoing phase 1 clinical study with dcc-3014 and an update on future development plans\n",
      "\n",
      " waltham, mass.--(business wire)--deciphera pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq:dcph), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing key mechanisms of tumor drug resistance, today announced positive, preliminary, top-line data from the ongoing dose escalation part of the phase 1 clinical study with dcc-3014, the company’s investigational small molecule switch control inhibitor of csf1r, in patients with advanced malignancies. in addition, the company announced a plan to expand the phase 1 study to evaluate dcc-3014 in patients diagnosed with tenosynovial giant cell tumors (tgct). a review of further data from this phase 1 study will be presented at a medical meeting in 2019. “we are very pleased with the progress made to date in the phase 1 clinical study with dcc-3014, our selective, and potent small molecule inhibitor of csf1r”tweet this the phase 1 study was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of dcc-3014 in up to 55 patients. as of the data cut-off date of november 9, 2018, increasing doses of dcc-3014 were assessed in five dose cohorts across 24 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. this included one dose cohort that received 10 mg once daily (qd) and four dose cohorts that followed a schedule of once or twice-weekly maintenance dosing preceded by a five-day loading dose regimen at doses of up to 30 mg per dose. in addition, four patients are currently enrolled in a dose cohort that will receive 40 mg twice weekly preceded by a five-day loading regimen. preliminary pharmacokinetic (pk) analysis showed dose-proportional exposure for dcc-3014 that we believe supports twice-weekly maintenance dosing preceded by a five-day loading dose regimen. biomarker data demonstrated strong target engagement of csf1r, including material reductions in csf1r positive macrophages in the blood that we believe constitutes mechanistic proof-of-concept (mpoc) for dcc-3014. dcc-3014 was generally well tolerated in patients enrolled in the dose cohorts that received twice-weekly maintenance doses of dcc-3014 preceded by a five-day loading regimen at doses of up to 30 mg, which is summarized below: treatment emergent adverse events (teaes) were mostly grade 1 or 2; no grade 3 or 4 dcc-3014 related teaes in ≥10% of patients; no dose-limiting toxicities; and a maximum tolerated dose has yet to be established. in the dose-cohort that received 10 mg qd, clinically asymptomatic laboratory values were recorded as dose-limiting toxicities in two of seven patients. “we are very pleased with the progress made to date in the phase 1 clinical study with dcc-3014, our selective, and potent small molecule inhibitor of csf1r,” said michael d. taylor, ph.d., president and chief executive officer of deciphera. “based on the preliminary tolerability, pk, and mechanistic proof-of-concept data observed to date, we believe dcc-3014 is well suited for further development. while we will continue to enroll further patients in this phase 1 study, we are planning to expand this study to enroll patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumors and to explore combinations with other therapies in the first half of 2019.” about dcc-3014 dcc-3014 is an investigational, orally administered, potent and highly selective inhibitor of csf1r. dcc-3014 was designed using the company’s proprietary switch control kinase inhibitor platform to selectively bind to the csf1r switch pocket. dcc-3014 has greater than 100-fold selectivity for csf1r over the closely related kinases flt3, kit, pdgfrα, pdgfrß and vegfr2 and has an even greater selectivity for csf1r over approximately 300 other human kinases. csf1r controls the differentiation and function of macrophages including tumor associated macrophages (tams) whose density within certain tumors including cancers of the breast, cervix, pancreas, bladder and brain correlates with poor prognosis. tumors induce tams to suppress a natural immune response mediated by cytotoxic t-cells, a type of lymphocyte that would otherwise eradicate the tumor; a process known as macrophage checkpoints. through inhibition of csf1r dcc-3014 has in preclinical studies demonstrated potent macrophage checkpoint inhibition as both a single agent and in combination with pd1 inhibitors and other t-cell checkpoint inhibitors. dcc-3014 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical study. for more information about the clinical trial design please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov (nct03069469). about tenosynovial giant cell tumors (tgcts) tenosynovial giant cell tumors (tgcts) are a group of benign tumors that involve the synovium, bursae and/or tendon sheath. although benign, these tumors can grow and cause damage to surrounding tissues and structures inducing pain, swelling, and limitation of movement of the joint. surgery is the main treatment option; however, these tumors tend to recur, particularly in pigmented villonodular synovitis, a diffuse-type of tgct. if untreated or if the tumor continually recurs damage and degeneration may occur in the affected joint and surrounding tissues, which may cause significant disability. a genetic mutation in certain cells within the tumor causes overproduction of csf-1, the ligand for the csf1r receptor, which attracts macrophages and certain other cells that become the bulk of these tumors and cause the associated inflammatory changes. about deciphera pharmaceuticals deciphera pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients by tackling key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and/or durability of response to existing cancer therapies. our small molecule drug candidates are directed against an important family of enzymes called kinases, known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. we use our deep understanding of kinase biology together with a proprietary chemistry library to purposefully design compounds that maintain kinases in a “switched off” or inactivated conformation. these investigational therapies comprise tumor-targeted agents designed to address therapeutic resistance causing mutations and immuno-targeted agents designed to control the activation of immunokinases that suppress critical immune system regulators, such as macrophages. we have used our platform to develop a diverse pipeline of tumor-targeted and immuno-targeted drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer by improving the quality, rate and/or durability of their responses to treatment. availability of other information about deciphera pharmaceuticals investors and others should note that deciphera pharmaceuticals communicates with its investors and the

      "acadia pharmaceuticals announces positive top-line results from phase 2 clarity trial of pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd)\n",
      "\n",
      " san diego--(business wire)--acadia pharmaceuticals inc. (nasdaq: acad) today announced positive top-line results from clarity, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, sequential parallel comparison design (spcd) study in major depressive disorder (mdd). in the study, 207 adult patients with a confirmed inadequate response to existing first-line ssri or snri therapy for mdd received adjunctive treatment of either 34 mg pimavanserin or placebo in addition to pre-existing first-line therapy for five weeks (stage 1). those patients who did not show a response to placebo in stage 1 were re-randomized to receive either pimavanserin or placebo for a second five-week treatment period (stage 2). in the trial, pimavanserin met the overall primary endpoint of the weighted average results of stage 1 and stage 2 by significantly reducing 17-item hamilton depression rating scale (hamd-17) total score compared to placebo (p=0.039). in addition, in stage 1 (n=207) patients on pimavanserin demonstrated a highly significant improvement in hamd-17 (p=0.0003). importantly, this group of patients saw a benefit over placebo in the first week of treatment (p=0.0365). stage 2 (n=58) results did not demonstrate significant separation in this small set of placebo non-responders. on the key secondary endpoint, pimavanserin demonstrated statistically significant reductions compared to placebo in the sheehan disability scale (sds) score (p=0.004). positive results were also observed for seven of the eleven other secondary endpoints listed below with nominal p-values: clinical global impression-severity (p=0.0084), clinical global impression-improvement (p=0.0289), short form-12 mental component summary (p<0.0001), karolinska sleepiness scale (p=0.0205), massachusetts general hospital sexual functioning index (p=0.0003), barratt impulsiveness scale (p=0.0075), as well as response rates (p=0.0065), defined as a 50% or greater reduction on the hamd-17 total score. in this phase 2 study, pimavanserin was generally well-tolerated. discontinuations due to adverse events were 1.2% for pimavanserin and 3.2% for placebo. one subject in each of the pimavanserin and placebo groups reported serious adverse events (saes). these saes were deemed not to be related to the study drug by the investigators and both subjects completed the study. no deaths were reported in the study. “we are pleased with the robustness of the data from our phase 2 clarity trial, which shows significant promise for patients with mdd, including early and sustained antidepressant response over placebo, decreased daytime sleepiness, no meaningful weight gain, and improved sexual function. this is important because most people with mdd do not respond to initial antidepressant therapies and experience significant unwanted side effects,” said serge stankovic, m.d., m.s.p.h., acadia's executive vice president, head of research & development. “pimavanserin is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or ssia, that shows great potential as an antidepressant. we look forward to engaging with the fda and initiating a phase 3 program in the first half of 2019.” “the results of this study suggest pimavanserin may represent a novel approach to adjunctive treatment for patients suffering from major depressive disorder. the selective serotonergic mechanism of action may provide additional benefit for patients who do not adequately respond to ssri or snri treatment,” said professor maurizio fava, m.d., executive vice chair, department of psychiatry, massachusetts general hospital (mgh) and associate dean for clinical & translational research, harvard medical school. “the majority of patients with mdd do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy and the treatment effect seen in this study combined with a favorable tolerability profile provides evidence that adjunctive therapy with pimavanserin may benefit patients suffering from inadequate response in major depressive disorder.” about clarityclarity was a phase 2, 10-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, 2-stage sequential parallel comparison design (spcd) study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pimavanserin (34 mg once daily) as an adjunctive treatment in patients with mdd who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of standard antidepressant therapy with either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri). the study was conducted in collaboration with the mgh clinical trials network & institute (ctni) and randomized 207 patients across 28 clinical research centers in the united states. consistent with the spcd design, the study was conducted in two, five-week sequential stages. eligible subjects continued receiving their ssri or snri antidepressant at a stable dose for the duration of the study. patients were randomly assigned (1:3) to pimavanserin 34 mg/day or placebo in stage 1. placebo non-responders in stage 1 (defined as hamd-17 total score >14 and a percent-reduction from baseline in hamd-17 total score of <50% at week 5) were re-randomized (1:1) to stage 2 to receive pimavanserin 34 mg/day or placebo. the primary endpoint of the study was the change in hamd-17 total score for stage 1 and stage 2. treatment differences from stage 1 and stage 2 were combined as weighted averages. a post-hoc comparison between pimavanserin (n=51) and placebo (n=123) for patients consistently receiving either placebo or pimavanserin for the entire 10-week period also yielded meaningful separation with positive p-values at all weeks starting from week 2 to week 10 in favor of pimavanserin for both the primary endpoint, hamd-17 (week 10, p=0.0076), and the key secondary endpoint, sds (week 10, p=0.0094). conference call and webcast informationacadia will discuss top-line results from its phase 2 trial of pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of patients with major depressive disorder via conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. eastern time. the conference call can be accessed by dialing 855-638-4820 for participants in the u.s. or

section and archived until november 30, 2018. about major depressive disorder (mdd)according to the national institute of mental health, mdd affects approximately 16 million adults in the united states1, with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy2,3. mdd is a condition characterized by depressive symptoms, such as a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities for more than two weeks, as well as impaired social, occupational or other important functioning. the majority of people who suffer from mdd do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy4. about pimavanserinpimavanserin is a selective serotonin inverse agonist (ssia) preferentially targeting 5-ht2a receptors. these receptors are thought to play an important role in depression, psychosis, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. acadia is evaluating pimavanserin in an extensive clinical development program across multiple indications with significant unmet need including dementia-related psychosis, schizophrenia inadequate response, schizophrenia-negative symptoms, and major depressive disorder. pimavanserin (34 mg) was approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with parkinson’s disease psychosis by the u.s. food and drug administration in april 2016 under the trade name nuplazid®. nuplazid is not approved for the adjunctive treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. about acadia pharmaceuticalsacadia is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative

      "ironwood pharmaceuticals initiates phase 1 trial of iw-6463, the first cns-penetrant sgc stimulator to enter clinical trials\n",
      "\n",
      " cambridge, mass.--(business wire)--ironwood pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: irwd) today announced the initiation of a phase 1 study evaluating iw-6463 in healthy volunteers. iw-6463 is an orally administered central nervous system (cns)-penetrant soluble guanylate cyclase (sgc) stimulator that is being developed for the treatment of serious and orphan cns disorders. data from the phase 1 study are expected in the second half of 2019. “the initiation of this phase 1 study with iw-6463 marks an important milestone for our portfolio of next-generation sgc stimulators”tweet this “the initiation of this phase 1 study with iw-6463 marks an important milestone for our portfolio of next-generation sgc stimulators,” said chris wright, m.d., ph.d., ironwood’s current head of development and incoming chief medical officer and head of development of cyclerion therapeutics, inc. (cyclerion). “with its ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, we believe iw-6463 may represent an important option for the treatment of serious neurodegenerative diseases, where there is a high unmet medical need. our phase 1 study is designed to provide safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data on single- and multiple-ascending doses of iw-6463, as well as to explore evidence of translation of some of our pre-clinical results on cns activity in this first-in-human study.” the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral iw-6463 in healthy volunteers. the study will evaluate both single-ascending and multiple-ascending doses of iw-6463 in healthy subjects using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, sequential-group design. iw-6463 is one of five differentiated sgc stimulator programs expected to be advanced by cyclerion, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on breakthrough treatments for serious and orphan diseases. the separation of ironwood and cyclerion is on track to be completed in the first half of 2019. about iw-6463 sgc stimulators are small molecules that act synergistically with nitric oxide on sgc to boost production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp). cgmp is a key second messenger that, when produced by sgc, regulates diverse and critical biological functions throughout the body including blood flow and vascular dynamics, inflammation and fibrosis, metabolism and neuronal function. cyclerion expects to advance a portfolio of five sgc stimulators, each designed to target tissues most relevant to the diseases they are intended to treat. as an orally administered sgc stimulator that has been shown pre-clinically to readily cross the blood-brain barrier, iw-6463 presents the opportunity to expand the utility of sgc pharmacology to serious neurodegenerative diseases. clinical and nonclinical research suggests that nitric oxide signaling plays a critical role in the cns in memory formation and retention, control of cerebral blood flow and modulation of neuroinflammation. nitric oxide is a potent neurotransmitter, and impaired nitric oxide-sgc-cgmp signaling is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. in preclinical models, iw-6463 has been associated with an increase in cerebral blood flow, improved neuronal health and function, reduced markers of neuroinflammation and enhanced cognition. cns pharmacological activity of iw-6463 has been observed preclinically using multiple non-invasive techniques that can be employed in clinical studies. about cyclerion therapeutics cyclerion therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company harnessing the power of sgc pharmacology to discover, develop and commercialize breakthrough treatments for serious and orphan diseases. cyclerion plans to advance its portfolio of five differentiated sgc stimulator programs with distinct pharmacologic and biodistribution properties that are uniquely designed to target tissues of greatest relevance to the diseases they are intended to treat. these programs, each of which have important milestones in 2019, include olinciguat in phase 2 development for sickle cell disease, praliciguat in phase 2 trials for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (hfpef) and for diabetic nephropathy, iw-6463 in phase 1 development for serious and orphan central nervous system diseases, and two late-stage discovery programs targeting serious liver and lung diseases, respectively. about ironwood pharmaceuticals ironwood pharmaceuticals (nasdaq: irwd) is a commercial biotechnology company focused on creating medicines that make a difference for patients, building value for our fellow shareholders, and empowering our passionate team. we discovered, developed and are commercializing linaclotide, the u.s. branded prescription market leader for adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (ibs-c) or chronic idiopathic constipation (cic). our pipeline priorities for linaclotide include a phase iiib trial evaluating its efficacy and safety on multiple abdominal symptoms, including abdominal bloating, pain, and discomfort in adult patients with ibs-c, as well as research into a formulation of linaclotide designed to relieve abdominal pain associated with ibs. we are also advancing a pipeline of innovative product candidates in areas of significant unmet need, including persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease, and the product candidates that cyclerion expects to advance following completion of the planned separation of ironwood and cyclerion into two independent, publicly-traded companies. the separation is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019. ironwood was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in cambridge, mass. for more information, please visit www.ironwoodpharma.com or www.twitter.com/ironwoodpharma;

      "bristol-myers squibb presents updated efficacy data from phase 2 trial of empliciti (elotuzumab) plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrmm)\n",
      "\n",
      " princeton, n.j.--(business wire)--bristol-myers squibb company (nyse: bmy) today announced the presentation of updated data from eloquent-3, the international randomized phase 2 study evaluating empliciti (elotuzumab) plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (epd) versus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pd) alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrmm). in a non-prespecified analysis conducted to provide a descriptive assessment of overall survival (os) after extended follow-up of at least 18.3 months, patients treated with epd continued to experience sustained and clinically relevant os and progression-free survival (pfs) benefits compared with patients treated with pd. $bmy anounced new relapsed/refractory multiple #myeloma data at #eha24tweet this treatment with epd was associated with a 46% reduction in risk of death [hazard ratio (hr) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.30 to 0.96] versus treatment with pd alone. at 18 months, rates of os, a secondary endpoint, were 68% for patients treated with epd compared to 49% for patients treated with pd. median os was not reached with epd [95% ci: 24.9 months, not estimable (ne)] at the time of analysis and was 17.4 months (95% ci: 13.8, ne) among patients receiving pd. eighteen-month pfs rates were 34% among patients randomized to epd compared to 11% among patients randomized to pd. safety results for epd were consistent with the primary analysis and with prior findings for empliciti and pomalidomide regimens. these data will be presented at the 24th congress of the european hematology association (eha) in amsterdam in a poster display (abstract #ps1370) on saturday, june 15 from 5:30-7 pm cest. “multiple myeloma is a disease characterized by relapse, making it all the more important to have effective options available for patients after initial treatments. with 18 months of follow-up from the eloquent-3 trial, we continue to see meaningful improvements across key endpoints with epd versus pd alone, including a positive trend in overall survival,” said meletios a. dimopoulos, m.d., professor and chairman of the department of clinical therapeutics at kapodistrian university of athens school of medicine. “these data point to the potential for this combination to become a new standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma that returned after or did not respond to prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.” “the extended follow-up results from eloquent-3 reinforce the epd combination’s sustained efficacy and favorable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma,” said fouad namouni, m.d., head, oncology development, bristol-myers squibb. “these data, along with our overall presence at eha, underscore our commitment to leading innovative research in hematology and developing therapies that can improve long-term survival for patients with different types of blood cancer.” data from the primary analysis of eloquent-3 were published in the new england journal of medicine in november 2018 and supported the approval of epd by the u.s. food and drug administration for the treatment of adult patients with rrmm who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. bristol-myers squibb and abbvie are co-developing empliciti, with bristol-myers squibb solely responsible for commercial activities. about eloquent-3 the phase 2 eloquent-3 trial randomized 117 patients with rrmm who received two or more prior therapies and were either refractory or relapsed and refractory to lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either epd (n=60) or pd (n=57) in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. patients in both the epd and pd arms received 4 mg of pomalidomide for days 1-21 of each cycle, and the weekly equivalent of 40 mg or 20 mg dexamethasone for patients ≤75 years or >75 years, respectively. in the epd arm, empliciti was administered intravenously at the dose of 10 mg/kg weekly for the first 2 cycles and 20 mg/kg every four weeks starting from cycle 3. the primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed pfs. in the 18-month follow-up analysis, adverse events (aes) were comparable between treatment arms and consistent with the primary analysis. the most common grade 3-4 aes were infections (22% among patients receiving epd, 24% among patients receiving pd), neutropenia (13%, 29%), anemia (10%, 22%), thrombocytopenia (10%, 7%) and hyperglycemia (8%, 11%). grade 5 all-cause aes occurred in seven patients (12%) who received epd and nine patients (16%) who received pd. bristol-myers squibb: advancing oncology research at bristol-myers squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. the focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and immuno-oncology (i-o) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. we source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like i-o, a reality for patients. about empliciti empliciti is an immunostimulatory antibody that specifically targets signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 7 (slamf7), a cell-surface glycoprotein. slamf7 is expressed on myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities. slamf7 also is expressed on natural killer cells, plasma cells and at lower levels on specific immune cell subsets of differentiated cells within the hematopoietic lineage. empliciti has a dual mechanism of action. it directly activates the immune system through natural killer cells via the slamf7 pathway. empliciti also targets slamf7 on myeloma cells, tagging these malignant cells for natural killer cell-mediated destruction via antibody-dependent cellular toxicity. empliciti was initially approved by the fda in 2015 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies. u.s. fda-approved indications for empliciti® empliciti® (elotuzumab) is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies. empliciti® (elotuzumab) is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. important safety information infusion reactions infusion reactions were reported in 10% of patients treated with empliciti in the eloquent-2 trial [empliciti + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (erd) vs lenalidomide + dexamethasone (rd)] and 3.3% in the eloquent-3 trial [empliciti + pomalidomide + dexamethasone (epd) vs pomalidomide + dexamethasone (pd)]. in the eloquent-2 trial, all infusion reactions were grade 3 or lower, with grade 3 infusion reactions occurring in 1% of patients. the most common symptoms included fever, chills, and hypertension. bradycardia and hypotension also developed during infusions. in the trial, 5% of patients required interruption of the administration of empliciti for a median of 25 minutes due to infusion reactions, and 1% of patients discontinued due to infusion reactions. of the patients who experienced an infusion reaction, 70% (23/33) had them during the first dose. in the eloquent-3 trial, the only infusion reaction symptom was chest discomfort (2%), which was grade 1. all the patients who experienced an infusion reaction had them during the first treatment cycle. if a grade 2 or higher infusion reaction occurs, interrupt the empliciti infusion and institute appropriate medical and supportive measures. if the infusion reaction recurs, stop the empliciti infusion and do not restart it on that day. severe infusion reactions may require permanent discontinuation of empliciti therapy and emergency treatment. premedicate with dexamethasone, h1 blocker, h2 blocker, and acetaminophen prior to empliciti infusion. infections in the eloquent-2 trial (n=635), infections were reported in 81% of patients in the erd arm and 74% in the rd arm. grade 3-4 infections were 28% (erd) and 24% (rd). discontinuations due to infections were 3.5% (erd) and 4.1% (rd). fatal infections were 2.5% (erd) and 2.2% (rd). opportunistic infections were reported in 22% (erd) and 13% (rd). fungal infections were 10% (erd) and 5% (rd). herpes zoster was 14% (erd) and 7% (rd). in the eloquent-3 trial (n=115), infections were reported in 65% of patients in both the epd arm and the pd arm. grade 3-4 infections were reported in 13% (epd) and 22% (pd). discontinuations due to infections were 7% (epd) and 5% (pd). fatal infections were 5% (epd) and 3.6% (pd). opportunistic infections were reported in 10% (epd) and 9% (pd). herpes zoster was reported in 5% (epd) and 1.8% (pd). monitor patients for development of infections and treat promptly. second primary malignancies in the eloquent-2 trial (n=635), invasive second primary malignancies (spm) were 9% (erd) and 6% (rd). the rate of hematologic malignancies was the same between erd and rd treatment arms (1.6%). solid tumors were reported in 3.5% (erd) and 2.2% (rd). skin cancer was reported in 4.4% (erd) and 2.8% (rd). in the eloquent-3 trial (n=115), invasive spms were 0% (epd) and 1.8% (pd). monitor patients for the development of spms. hepatotoxicity in the eloquent-2 trial (n=635), ast/alt >3x the upper limit, total bilirubin >2x the upper limit, and alkaline phosphatase <2x the upper limit were 2.5% (erd) vs 0.6% (rd). of 8 patients experiencing hepatotoxicity, 2 patients discontinued treatment while 6 patients had resolution and continued. monitor liver enzymes periodically. stop empliciti upon ≥grade 3 elevation of liver enzymes. continuation of treatment may be considered after return to baseline values. interference with determination of complete response empliciti is a humanized igg kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous m-protein. this interference can impact the determination of complete response and possibly relapse from complete response in patients with igg kappa myeloma protein. pregnancy/females and males of reproductive potential there are no available data on empliciti use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. there is a risk of fetal harm, including severe life-threatening human birth defects, associated with lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and they are contraindicated for use in pregnancy. refer to the respective

      "chi-med initiates a phase i/ii clinical trial of novel fgfr inhibitor hmpl-453 in china\n",
      "\n",
      " london--(business wire)--hutchison china meditech limited (“chi-med”) (aim/nasdaq: hcm) has just initiated a phase i/ii clinical trial of hmpl-453 in china. hmpl-453 is a novel, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor (“fgfr”). the first drug dose was administered on june 19, 2017. this study complements the first-in-human phase i clinical trial in australia that was initiated earlier this year. this phase i/ii study is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, two-stage study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (“pk”) and preliminary efficacy of hmpl-453 monotherapy in patients with solid tumors harboring fgfr genetic alterations. the dose-escalation stage will enroll patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, for whom standard therapy either does not exist or has proven to be ineffective or intolerable, regardless genetic status, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and recommended phase ii dose (“rp2d”). the dose-escalation will be followed by a dose-expansion stage, which will further evaluate safety, tolerability and pk as well as preliminary anti-tumor efficacy at the rp2d. this stage will enroll primarily cancer patients harboring fgfr dysregulated tumors, including those with advanced bladder cancer, advanced cholangiocarcinoma and other solid tumors. for this second stage, the primary endpoint is objective response rate (orr), with secondary endpoints including duration of response (dor), disease control rate (dcr), progression free survival (pfs), overall survival (os) and safety. additional details about this study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov, using identifier nct03160833. about bladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma bladder cancer makes up approximately 90% of urothelial carcinomas. bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the u.s., and the ninth most common cancer in china, with about 80,000 new cases annually in both countries.[1], [2] in the u.s. the five-year survival rate for those whose disease has metastasized is approximately 5%.[1] despite advances in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the prognosis for patients remains poor and more treatment options are needed. a highly unmet medical need around the world, cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer, “cca”) accounts for approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers and is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract (the combined system of the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts).[3] cca is classified as intrahepatic or extrahepatic based on anatomical location, with studies suggesting that the incidence of intrahepatic cca in particular is increasing.[4] currently cca has a bleak prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%.[5] about fgfr fgfrs are a sub-family of receptor tyrosine kinases. activation of fgfr signaling pathways is central to several biological processes. in normal physiology, fgf/fgfr signaling is involved in embryonic development (organogenesis and morphogenesis), tissue repair, angiogenesis, neuroendocrine and metabolism homeostasis. given its complexity and critical role in a number of important physiological processes, aberrant fgfr signaling has been found to be a driving force in tumor growth, promotion of angiogenesis, as well as conferring resistance to anti-tumor therapies. to date, there are no approved therapies specifically targeting the fgfr signaling pathway. about hmpl-453 hmpl-453 is a novel, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor targeting fibroblast growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3. in pre-clinical studies, hmpl-453 demonstrated superior potency and better kinase selectivity as compared to other drugs in the same class, as well as a favorable safety profile. chi-med is also conducting a phase i study of hmpl-453 in australia, for which additional details can be found at clinicaltrials.gov, using identifier nct02966171. about chi-med chi-med is an innovative biopharmaceutical company which researches, develops, manufactures and sells pharmaceuticals and healthcare products. its innovation platform, hutchison medipharma limited, focuses on discovering and developing innovative therapeutics in oncology and autoimmune diseases for the global market. its commercial

      "enanta pharmaceuticals announces topline results showing edp-938 achieved its primary and secondary endpoints in its phase 2a human challenge study in healthy adults infected with respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)\n",
      "\n",
      " watertown, mass.--(business wire)--enanta pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq:enta), a research and development-focused biotechnology company dedicated to creating small molecule drugs for viral infections and liver diseases, today announced topline results that demonstrated that edp-938 achieved highly statistically significant (p<0.001) reductions in viral load and in resolution of clinical symptoms compared to placebo in its phase 2a human challenge study of edp-938 in healthy adults infected with respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). “rsv is a serious unmet medical need with no therapeutic treatment currently available”tweet this “rsv is a serious unmet medical need with no therapeutic treatment currently available,” stated jay r. luly, ph.d., president and chief executive officer. “based on today’s positive data for edp-938, the only n-inhibitor in clinical development, our goal is to initiate our first phase 2b study by the end of calendar 2019 in adult outpatients with confirmed rsv infections.” edp-938 phase 2a challenge study topline resultsthe phase 2a study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human challenge study in healthy adult subjects inoculated with rsv. subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 dosing arms or a placebo arm and received either a once-daily (qd) 600 mg dose, a single 500 mg loading dose (ld) followed by a 300 mg twice daily (bid) dose, or placebo for 5 days. a total of 115 subjects were enrolled and inoculated with the challenge virus. once rsv infection was confirmed, participants were then randomized: 38 in the placebo arm, 39 in the 600 mg qd arm (one subject was randomized, but never dosed), and 38 in the 500mg ld plus 300mg bid arm. a highly statistically significant reduction was observed for the primary efficacy endpoint, the area under the curve (auc) for viral load in the intent-to-treat-infected population (itt-i: all randomized subjects receiving challenge virus and at least one dose of study drug with confirmed rsv infection) for each of the edp-938 dosing groups as compared with placebo. specifically, edp-938 lowered viral load auc to 203.95 ± 173.50 hours x log10 copies/ml in the qd arm and 217.71 ± 217.55 hours x log10 copies/ml in the bid arm, compared to 790.15 ± 408.80 hours x log10 copies/ml in the placebo arm (p<0.001 for each of the edp-938 groups compared to placebo). there was no statistically significant difference between the two edp-938 dosing groups. for the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the auc for total symptom score (tss), a highly statistically significant reduction was observed in the itt-i population for each of the edp-938 dosing groups (124.47 hours x score ± 115.60 for the qd arm and 181.75 ± 248.42 hours x score for the bid arm, compared to 478.75 ± 422.29 hours x score in the placebo arm (p<0.001 for each of the edp-938 groups compared to placebo). there was no statistically significant difference between the two edp-938 dosing groups. edp-938 demonstrated good pharmacokinetics, and mean trough levels of drug were maintained at approximately 20-40x above the in vitro ec90 for rsv-infected human cells. overall, edp-938 was generally safe and well tolerated. edp-938 demonstrated a favorable safety profile over 5 days of dosing through day 28 of follow-up, comparable to placebo for both dosing groups. there were no serious adverse events and no discontinuation of study drug. the study will be presented at a future medical conference. conference call and webcast informationenanta will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. et. to participate in the live conference call,

of the call and replay can be accessed by visiting the “events and presentation” section on the “investors” page of enanta’s website at www.enanta.com. about edp-938edp-938, enanta’s lead n-protein inhibitor, is being developed for the treatment of rsv infection. enanta believes edp-938 is differentiated from fusion inhibitors currently in development by others for rsv because this n-protein inhibitor targets the virus’ replication machinery and has demonstrated high barriers to resistance against the virus in vitro. edp-938 has also been shown to reduce viral load below the level of detection in vivo. additionally, it is possible that n-protein inhibitors may be effective treatments at later stages of infection. about respiratory syncytial virusrespiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a virus that infects the lungs and represents a serious unmet medical need in infants and children. rsv is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children under 1 year of age in the united states. also at increased risk of a severe rsv infection are children with compromised (weakened) immune systems due to a medical condition or medical treatment, adults with compromised immune systems and those age 65 and older. recent estimates suggest that approximately 200,000 hospitalizations in the u.s. and eu occur each year in children under the age of two and approximately 170,000 hospitalizations in these regions occur in each year in adults aged 65 and older. there is currently no safe and effective therapy for already established rsv infection. about enantaenanta pharmaceuticals is using its robust, chemistry-driven approach and drug discovery capabilities to become a leader in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs for the treatment of viral infections and liver diseases. enanta’s research and development efforts are currently focused on the following disease targets: respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash)/ primary biliary cholangitis (pbc), and hepatitis b virus (hbv). enanta’s research and development activities are funded by royalties from hcv products developed under its collaboration with abbvie. glecaprevir, a protease inhibitor discovered by enanta, is now sold by abbvie in numerous countries as part of its newest treatment for chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. this leading hcv regimen is sold under the tradenames mavyret™ (u.s.) and maviret™ (ex-u.s.)

      "ligand partner retrophin reports additional positive data from phase 2 duet study of sparsentan in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis at asn kidney week 2016\n",
      "\n",
      " san diego--(business wire)--ligand pharmaceuticals incorporated (nasdaq:lgnd) partner retrophin, inc. today announced additional results from the phase 2 duet study of sparsentan for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs), a rare kidney disorder without an fda-approved pharmacologic treatment that often leads to end-stage renal disease. these new findings are being presented today in the late-breaking high-impact clinical trials oral session at the american society of nephrology (asn) kidney week 2016 in chicago. “the prevalence of fsgs is on the rise and without an approved therapy, many patients diagnosed with the disorder face a progressive decline and the high likelihood of end-stage renal disease”tweet this “the prevalence of fsgs is on the rise and without an approved therapy, many patients diagnosed with the disorder face a progressive decline and the high likelihood of end-stage renal disease,” said howard trachtman, md, professor of pediatrics; director, division of pediatric nephrology, nyu school of medicine, nyu langone medical center. “these findings from the duet study underscore the potential of sparsentan as a first-in-class treatment for fsgs.” as announced in september, top-line data from duet showed the sparsentan treatment group achieved statistical significance in the study’s primary efficacy endpoint, reduction of proteinuria. these results showed a greater than two-fold reduction of proteinuria compared to irbesartan, after an eight-week, double-blind treatment period. an analysis of the secondary endpoint presented today showed that a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving sparsentan achieved modified partial remission of proteinuria, compared to irbesartan-treated patients. modified partial remission, defined as proteinuria levels of less than or equal to 1.5 g/g and greater than 40 percent reduction of proteinuria from baseline, is associated with long-term preservation of renal function in fsgs. in addition, four patients receiving sparsentan achieved complete remission, compared to zero irbesartan-treated patients. also presented today was a post-hoc, intention-to-treat (itt) analysis showing that the sparsentan treatment group again demonstrated a greater than two-fold reduction of proteinuria, compared to irbesartan. further analysis of the safety database from the initial eight-week, double-blind treatment period presented today showed sparsentan was generally safe and well-tolerated. “these new results add to the growing body of evidence from the duet study, reinforcing our confidence that sparsentan may represent a significant advancement in the treatment of fsgs,” said stephen aselage, chief executive officer of retrophin. “we thank the duet investigators for their diligence, as well as the patients and their families for their commitment to finding new and better treatment options for fsgs.” new findings from the duet study presented at asn kidney week include: an analysis of the secondary endpoint, which showed that after the eight-week, double-blind treatment period, 28.1 percent of patients receiving sparsentan (n=64) achieved modified partial remission of proteinuria, compared to 9.4 percent of irbesartan-treated patients (n=32, p=0.040). the proportion of patients achieving modified partial remission increased during the open label period. after 48 weeks of treatment with sparsentan (n=26), 57.7 percent of patients achieved modified partial remission. in addition, 50.0 percent of patients that transferred from irbesartan to sparsentan at the beginning of the open label period achieved modified partial remission after 40 weeks of treatment (n=12). complete remission, defined as proteinuria less than 0.3 g/g, was achieved by four patients receiving sparsentan during the eight-week, double-blind treatment period, compared to zero irbesartan-treated patients. a post-hoc itt analysis (imputing zero change in proteinuria for the 13 patients missing baseline or week 8 data) showed a statistically significant difference in the mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline for the sparsentan treatment group (n=73), compared to the irbesartan group (n=36), after the study’s eight-week, double-blind treatment period. the sparsentan group achieved a 42.7 percent mean reduction of proteinuria compared to 15.7 percent for the irbesartan group (p=0.004). the itt analysis also showed that after eight weeks of treatment with 400 mg and 800 mg of sparsentan (n=60), the mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline was 44.8 percent, compared to 15.9 percent for the irbesartan-treated patients in these two cohorts (n=28, p=0.008). during the eight-week, double-blind period, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (teae) for the sparsentan group was similar to the irbesartan group, except for edema. the severity of edema did not significantly worsen from baseline and no patients withdrew from the study as a result of edema during the eight-week, double-blind treatment period. the most common teaes in the study were headache, hypotension, dizziness, edema, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and upper abdominal pain. the incidence of serious adverse events was similar across both groups. 84 percent of patients who completed the eight-week, double blind treatment period continue to receive sparsentan in the open-label extension. about the duet study the duet study is an international, randomized, double-blind, phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in 109 patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs), of which 96 qualified for the evaluable efficacy database. the primary endpoint is the reduction of proteinuria, as compared to irbesartan, which is part of a class of drugs used to manage fsgs in the absence of an fda-approved pharmacologic treatment. after a two-week washout period, patients were randomized to receive daily oral doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg of sparsentan or 300 mg of irbesartan. after completing an initial eight weeks of randomized treatment, all patients were eligible to receive sparsentan as part of the study’s open-label extension. about focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or fsgs, is a rare disorder without an fda-approved pharmacologic treatment option that is estimated to affect up to 40,000 patients in the u.s. with similar prevalence in europe. the disorder is defined by progressive scarring of the kidney and often leads to end-stage renal disease. fsgs is characterized by proteinuria, where protein is found in the urine due to a breakdown of the normal filtration mechanism in the kidney. other common symptoms include swelling in parts of the body known as edema, as well as low blood albumin levels, abnormal lipid profiles, and hypertension. reduction in proteinuria is widely regarded to be beneficial in the treatment of fsgs, and may be associated with a decreased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. achieving modified partial remission of proteinuria, defined as proteinuria levels of less than or equal to 1.5 g/g and greater than 40 percent reduction of proteinuria from baseline, is associated with long-term preservation of renal function in patients with fsgs. in the absence of an fda-approved pharmacologic treatment, patients with fsgs are currently managed with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, and steroids. about sparsentan sparsentan could be the first fda-approved pharmacologic treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or fsgs, a rare kidney disorder that often leads to end-stage renal disease. sparsentan’s dual mechanism of action combines angiotensin receptor blockade with endothelin receptor type a blockade. in several forms of chronic kidney disease, endothelin receptor blockade has been shown to have an additive beneficial effect on proteinuria in combination with renin-angiotensin blockade via angiotensin receptor blockade or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. the phase 2 duet study of sparsentan met the primary efficacy endpoint for the combined treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction of proteinuria compared to irbesartan, after the eight-week, double-blind treatment period. retrophin is working with the fda to determine the most expeditious path forward to advance the development of sparsentan towards approval. in 2015, the fda and european commission each granted sparsentan orphan drug designation for the treatment of fsgs. about ligand pharmaceuticals ligand is a biopharmaceutical company focused

this release. these include statements regarding the possible use of sparsentan as a treatment options for fsgs, the timing and results of review by the food and drug administration (fda) of sparsentan, retrophin’s plans to present the duet study results at an upcoming medical meeting or in a peer-reviewed publication, and the ability of patients to continue in an open-label study of sparsentan. actual events or results may differ from our expectations. for example, ligand has no control whether retrophin terminates the open-label study of sparsentan, including due to adverse events reported by patients, there can be no assurance that success in a phase 2 clinical trial will result in success in future clinical trials; the safety and tolerability data from a new clinical trial in sparsentan may conflict with the results of the phase 2 duet clinical trial; and the number of patients diagnoses with fsgs may be more or fewer than retrophin believes. the failure to meet expectations with respect to any of the foregoing matters may reduce ligand's stock price. additional information concerning these and other important risk factors affecting ligand can be found in ligand's prior press releases available at www.ligand.com as well as in ligand's public periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission, available at www.sec.gov. ligand disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements beyond the date of this press release, except as required by law. this caution is made under the safe harbor provisions of the private
